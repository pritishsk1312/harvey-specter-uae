## Shareholder Agreement — Essential Clauses

### Pre-Emption Rights (Article 230-231, CCL)

```
SAMPLE CLAUSE — PRE-EMPTION WAIVER FOR DRAG-ALONG:

"Notwithstanding any pre-emption rights under the Articles or 
applicable law, each Shareholder hereby irrevocably waives any 
pre-emption rights in connection with a Drag-Along Sale, provided 
that such sale is conducted in accordance with Clause [X] of this 
Agreement."
```

### Drag-Along Rights

```
SAMPLE CLAUSE:

"If Shareholders holding [75]% or more of the issued share capital 
(the "Dragging Shareholders") agree to sell their Shares to a 
bona fide third party purchaser (a "Drag-Along Sale"), the 
Dragging Shareholders may require all other Shareholders (the 
"Dragged Shareholders") to sell their Shares on the same terms 
and conditions.

The Dragging Shareholders shall give the Dragged Shareholders 
not less than [30] days' written notice of the proposed Drag-Along 
Sale, including:
(a) the identity of the proposed purchaser;
(b) the proposed price per Share;
(c) the material terms of the sale; and
(d) the proposed completion date."
```

### Tag-Along Rights

```
SAMPLE CLAUSE:

"If any Shareholder (the "Selling Shareholder") proposes to 
Transfer [50]% or more of its Shares to a third party, each 
other Shareholder (the "Tagging Shareholder") shall have the 
right, but not the obligation, to participate in such sale on 
the same terms and conditions, pro rata to their shareholding.

The Selling Shareholder shall give written notice to all other 
Shareholders not less than [30] days prior to the proposed 
Transfer, and each Tagging Shareholder shall have [15] days 
from receipt of such notice to exercise its tag-along right."
```

### Deadlock Resolution

```
SAMPLE CLAUSE:

"If the Shareholders are unable to resolve a Deadlock Matter 
within [30] days of it arising:

(a) the Shareholders shall first attempt to resolve the matter 
    through mediation administered by [DIAC/DIFC-LCIA];
    
(b) if mediation is unsuccessful within [30] days, either 
    Shareholder may initiate a "shoot-out" (or "Russian roulette") 
    procedure whereby:
    
    (i) the initiating Shareholder shall offer to purchase all 
        Shares of the other Shareholder at a stated price per 
        Share (the "Offer Price"); and
        
    (ii) the receiving Shareholder shall, within [30] days, 
         either accept the offer or elect to purchase all Shares 
         of the initiating Shareholder at the Offer Price."

## SAFE Notes & Convertible Notes in UAE

### Jurisdiction Considerations

| Instrument | Best Jurisdiction | Why |
|------------|-------------------|-----|
| SAFE Note | DIFC/ADGM | Common law enforceability, no debt treatment |
| Convertible Note | DIFC/ADGM | Can register security with DIFC ROS |
| Either | Mainland LLC | Possible but less established |

### SAFE Note — Key Terms

```
STANDARD UAE SAFE TERMS (2024-2025 MARKET):

Valuation Cap: $3M - $10M (pre-seed); $8M - $25M (seed)
Discount: 15% - 25%
Pro Rata Rights: Standard for checks > $50K
MFN Clause: Standard

POST-MONEY vs PRE-MONEY:
- Post-money SAFE (Y Combinator standard): Investor knows exact 
  ownership % at signing
- Pre-money SAFE: Ownership depends on future SAFEs issued
- Market trend: Post-money now dominant (88% per Carta Q1 2024)
```

### Convertible Note — Key Terms

```
STANDARD UAE CONVERTIBLE NOTE TERMS:

Principal: Investment amount
Interest Rate: 4% - 8% annually (simple interest)
Maturity: 18 - 24 months
Valuation Cap: Same as SAFE
Discount: 15% - 25%
Qualified Financing Trigger: $500K - $1M minimum raise

CONVERSION MECHANICS:
At Qualified Financing, note converts at LOWER of:
(a) Valuation Cap / Pre-Money Fully Diluted Shares
(b) (1 - Discount) × Price Per Share in Qualified Financing
```

### Worked Example — SAFE Conversion

```
SCENARIO:
- SAFE Investment: $500,000
- Valuation Cap: $5,000,000 (post-money)
- Discount: 20%
- Series A Valuation: $15,000,000 pre-money
- Series A Price Per Share: $1.50

CALCULATION:

Step 1: Cap Price
$5,000,000 / Pre-Money Shares = Cap Price
Assume 10,000,000 pre-money shares
Cap Price = $5,000,000 / 10,000,000 = $0.50/share

Step 2: Discount Price
$1.50 × (1 - 0.20) = $1.20/share

Step 3: Conversion Price (lower of cap or discount)
$0.50 < $1.20
Conversion Price = $0.50/share

Step 4: Shares Issued
$500,000 / $0.50 = 1,000,000 shares

RESULT: Cap dominates. Investor gets 3× more shares than Series A 
investors for same $$ investment.
