# Contract Review — UAE

## UAE Contract Law Fundamentals

### Formation Requirements (UAE Civil Code, Federal Law No. 5 of 1985)

```
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS:

1. OFFER & ACCEPTANCE (Articles 130-140)
   - Clear, definite terms
   - Acceptance must mirror offer
   - Silence ≠ acceptance (generally)

2. LEGAL CAPACITY (Articles 84-115)
   - Natural persons: Age of majority (21) or emancipated minor
   - Legal persons: Within scope of authority
   - Contracts by incapacitated persons: Voidable

3. LAWFUL SUBJECT MATTER (Article 197)
   - Must be possible
   - Must be defined or definable
   - Must be lawful (not contrary to public policy/Sharia)

4. LAWFUL CAUSE (Articles 198-202)
   - Every obligation must have a cause
   - Cause must be lawful
   - Unlawful cause = void contract

5. CONSENT (Articles 176-195)
   - Free from duress, fraud, mistake
   - Defective consent = voidable contract
```

## Good Faith Obligation (Article 246 — CRITICAL)

```
ARTICLE 246 (UAE CIVIL CODE):

"(1) The contract must be performed in accordance with its 
contents, and in a manner consistent with the requirements 
of good faith.

(2) The contract shall not be restricted to an obligation 
upon the contracting party to do that which is (expressly) 
contained in it, but shall also embrace that which is 
appurtenant to it by virtue of the law, custom, and the 
nature of the transaction."

IMPLICATIONS:
- Applies to ALL UAE contracts without exception
- Cannot be contracted out of
- Encompasses honesty, fairness, sincerity
- Courts can imply terms based on good faith
- Bad faith = potential damages under Article 106 (abuse of rights)

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:
- UAE courts generally apply to PERFORMANCE, not negotiation
- Exception: Insurance contracts (Article 1032 requires pre-contractual disclosure)
- "Bad faith" not defined — judicial discretion

PRACTICE TIP:
When reviewing contracts, consider: "Would enforcement of this clause 
in these circumstances constitute bad faith?" If yes, clause may be 
modified or unenforced by UAE courts.

## Freedom of Contract (Article 257)

```
ARTICLE 257:

"The contract is the law of the contracting parties. It may 
not be revoked or amended except by mutual consent or for 
reasons provided by law."

LIMITATIONS ON FREEDOM:
1. Mandatory provisions of law
2. Public policy (Article 205)
3. Sharia principles (Article 3)
4. Good faith (Article 246)
5. Consumer protection (where applicable)

EFFECT:
- Parties can generally agree to any lawful terms
- Courts will enforce negotiated terms
- But: Penalty clauses subject to judicial modification (Article 390)
- But: Exclusion of liability for fraud/willful misconduct void

## Contract Review Checklist

## Interest Rate Limits

```
UAE POSITION ON INTEREST:

- Commercial transactions: Interest generally enforceable
- Maximum rate: Courts may reduce excessive interest (typically >12%)
- Sharia considerations: Some judges may be conservative
- Compound interest: Generally not recognized

SAFE APPROACH:
- Cap contractual interest at 9-12%
- Use "late payment fee" language rather than "interest"
- Consider alternative remedies (suspension of services, acceleration)
```

## Electronic Contracts (Federal Decree-Law No. 46 of 2021)

```

- Electronic contracts enforceable
- Electronic records admissible as evidence

EXCEPTIONS (still require physical signature):
