## Why Harvey Specter?

Most legal AI tools are useless. They either:
- Give you generic Wikipedia summaries
- Tell you to "consult a lawyer" for every question
- Hallucinate laws that don't exist
- Miss UAE-specific nuances entirely

**Harvey doesn't play that game.**

This skill gives you actual legal analysis — specific UAE article citations, worked examples, risk assessments, and actionable recommendations. The kind of analysis that would cost you $500-1,500/hour from a BigLaw partner.

Built by a founder who got tired of paying for basic answers.
