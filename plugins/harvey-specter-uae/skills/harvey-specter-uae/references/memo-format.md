## Sample Memo: Employee Termination

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                        MEMORANDUM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TO:         [Client] (HR Matter)
FROM:       Harvey Specter
DATE:       January 20, 2026
RE:         Termination of Underperforming Employee — Risk Assessment

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

QUESTION PRESENTED

Under UAE Labour Law (Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021), can 
the Company terminate an employee of 3 years whose performance 
has declined over the past 6 months, without exposure to 
arbitrary dismissal claims?

SHORT ANSWER

Likely Yes, provided proper procedure is followed. Under 
Article 44(d) of the UAE Labour Law, an employer may terminate 
an employee for failure to perform basic duties after issuing 
two written warnings. Without documented warnings, the Company 
risks an arbitrary dismissal claim under Article 47, potentially 
resulting in compensation of up to 3 months' salary in addition 
to notice pay and gratuity.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STATEMENT OF FACTS

- Employee: Operations staff
- Start Date: January 2023
- Length of Service: 3 years
- Basic Salary: AED 12,000/month
- Total Package: AED 16,000/month (inc. housing)
- Performance: Declined over past 6 months per supervisor reports
- Documentation: No formal performance improvement plan on file
- Warnings: No written warnings issued to date
- Contract Type: Fixed-term (2 years, renewed once)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DISCUSSION

I. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE — PERFORMANCE GROUNDS

   A. Applicable Law
   
   Article 44(d) of the UAE Labour Law permits termination 
   without notice or gratuity if the employee "fails to perform 
   their basic duties under the employment contract despite 
   having received a written warning regarding the same on 
   two occasions."
   
   The written warnings must:
   - Be documented in writing
   - Specify the performance deficiency
   - Be acknowledged by the employee
   - Allow reasonable time for improvement
   
   B. Analysis
   
   Current Status: The Company has NOT issued formal written 
   warnings. Proceeding with termination now would NOT 
   qualify as termination for cause under Article 44(d).
   
   To rely on Article 44(d), the Company would need to:
   1. Issue First Written Warning (specify deficiencies, 
      improvement expected, timeframe)
   2. Allow reasonable improvement period (typically 30-60 days)
   3. If no improvement: Issue Second Written Warning
   4. Allow additional improvement period
   5. If still no improvement: Proceed with termination
   
   Total Timeline: Approximately 90-120 days
   
   C. Risk Assessment
   
   If the Company terminates now without warnings:
   - Cannot claim Article 44 exemption
   - Must pay notice period (as per contract)
   - Must pay full gratuity
   - MODERATE RISK of arbitrary dismissal claim (Article 47)
   - Potential additional compensation: Up to AED 36,000 (3 months)

II. TERMINATION WITH NOTICE — RECOMMENDED APPROACH

   A. Applicable Law
   
   Article 43 permits either party to terminate a fixed-term 
   contract by giving notice as specified in the contract 
   (minimum 30 days, maximum 90 days).
   
   B. Analysis
   
   Given absence of documented warnings, the lower-risk 
   approach is to terminate with notice under Article 43.
   
   Financial Obligations:
   - Notice Period: Per contract (assume 30 days) = AED 12,000
   - Gratuity: 3 years × 21 days × (AED 12,000/30) = AED 25,200
   - Accrued Leave: [Calculate based on unused days]
   - Total: ~AED 37,200 + accrued leave
   
   Payment Deadline: Within 14 days of termination
   
   C. Risk Assessment
   
   If the Company terminates with notice and pays all entitlements:
   - LOW RISK of successful legal challenge
   - No "for cause" stigma for employee
   - Clean separation

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONCLUSION

The Company can terminate the employee but should proceed with 
notice under Article 43 rather than attempting termination for 
cause under Article 44. The absence of documented warnings makes 
a "for cause" termination legally vulnerable. Paying full notice 
and gratuity significantly reduces litigation risk.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. IMMEDIATE: Calculate final settlement (notice + gratuity + 
   leave) and confirm budget approval.

2. WITHIN 7 DAYS: Prepare termination letter citing Article 43 
   (termination with notice). Do NOT reference performance issues.

3. UPON DELIVERY: Offer employee option to receive payment in 
   lieu of notice (garden leave). Obtain signed acknowledgment.

4. WITHIN 14 DAYS OF LAST DAY: Process final settlement payment 
   and obtain signed clearance.

5. ONGOING: For future cases, implement formal performance 
   management process with documented warnings to preserve 
   Article 44 rights.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GRATUITY CALCULATION (WORKED)

Basic Salary: AED 12,000/month
Daily Wage: AED 12,000 ÷ 30 = AED 400/day

Service: 3 years (within first 5 years)
Formula: 21 days × AED 400 × 3 years

Gratuity: AED 25,200
