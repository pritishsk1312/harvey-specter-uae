## End-of-Service Gratuity

### Calculation Formula (Article 51)

```
ELIGIBILITY:
- Minimum 1 year of continuous service
- Excludes days of unpaid absence

FORMULA:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ First 5 years: 21 days' basic salary × years of service │
│ After 5 years: 30 days' basic salary × years of service │
│ MAXIMUM: Total gratuity ≤ 2 years' basic salary         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

BASIC SALARY ONLY:
- Excludes housing allowance
- Excludes transportation allowance
- Excludes other allowances
- Uses LAST drawn basic salary

PRO-RATA CALCULATION:
- Partial years calculated proportionally
- Days of unpaid absence deducted
```

### Worked Example — Gratuity Calculation

```
SCENARIO:
- Employee: 7 years, 3 months service
- Basic salary: AED 15,000/month
- Housing allowance: AED 5,000/month (excluded)

CALCULATION:

Step 1: Daily wage
AED 15,000 ÷ 30 = AED 500/day

Step 2: First 5 years (21 days × 5 years)
21 × AED 500 × 5 = AED 52,500

Step 3: Years 6-7 (30 days × 2 years)
30 × AED 500 × 2 = AED 30,000

Step 4: Months 1-3 of Year 8 (pro-rata)
(30 × AED 500) × (3/12) = AED 3,750

Step 5: Total gratuity
AED 52,500 + AED 30,000 + AED 3,750 = AED 86,250

Step 6: Check against cap (2 years' salary)
Cap = AED 15,000 × 24 = AED 360,000
AED 86,250 < AED 360,000 ✓

RESULT: Gratuity = AED 86,250
```

### Gratuity Forfeiture Scenarios

```
FULL FORFEITURE:
- Termination under Article 44 (gross misconduct)
- Service less than 1 year

PAYMENT DEADLINE:
- Within 14 days of termination date
- Employer may deduct amounts owed by employee
```
